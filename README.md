## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

I'm getting started with sass/scss. I really like how it changes the organization of stylesheets. Since i'm beginning it
may look a bit messy but I'm proud of the file hierarchy I've set up for this project.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
